                    This year's theme highlights the sense of urgency, both in the political and socio-economic sense,
                    that is to come in the new year. We are at this tipping point where any sort of butterfly effect can 
                    bring vast changes to the world around us. On the same token, 2020 vision is implicit to the significance of 
                    the future, the role of the past in that future (hindsight and foresight), as well as what we see and can not 
                    see.
